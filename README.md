# Swingy Forex Software

## Description
Swingy Forex Software is a trading application developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This software is designed to optimize trading strategies by utilizing historical maximum drawdown (DD) data and executing trades based on specified parameters.

The program calculates the lotsize for each currency pair using the historical maximum drawdown value. The lotsize is calculated based on a predetermined logic, which can be adjusted according to specific requirements. 

Once the lotsize is calculated, the program executes trades for each currency pair. The trades are executed with the specified lotsize, take profit (TP), and stop loss (SL) values. The execution logic is handled internally by the program.

## How it works
1. The program initializes the historical maximum drawdown (DD) values for each currency pair. These values represent the maximum drawdown experienced by each currency pair in the past.
2. The program sets the take profit (TP) and stop loss (SL) values for each currency pair. These values determine the target profit and the maximum loss allowed for each trade.
3. The program iterates over the currency pairs and executes trades for each pair.
4. For each currency pair, the program calculates the lotsize using the historical maximum drawdown value.
5. The program then executes the trade for the currency pair with the calculated lotsize, TP, and SL values.
6. Additional trade execution steps can be added as per specific requirements.
